In the translation, I use the following code :

 - When a line starts with '/*', it means I am not satisfied with
 the translation I used and that is needs rephrasing.
 
 
 The file 'translation-notes.rtf' serves as a notepad for me.
 
 The file 'title_screen_tracy's_melancholy_jap.BMP' shows the title screen of the last ending.
 I don't know how this is stored in the game but, this will have to be translated
 as :
	肉奴隷			Sex slave
	トレイシーの憂鬱	Tracy's melancholy
