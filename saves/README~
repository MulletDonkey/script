Take any .DAT file and put it in the .fdi file after having renamed it anything like "SAVE#.dat" (# from 1 to 5).
You can use anxdiet.exe which is packaged with Anex86.

The file names of the saves are built this way :
"A2.dat" for example indicates that you are in dream A and this is the second save I did on that path.

You can find the different endings on http://tryspace.net/game/xenon/
